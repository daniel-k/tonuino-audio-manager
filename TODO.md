# Bugs

- check text before/after (un)plugging usb drive
- shadow of `+` menu button
- close `+` menu when tapping somewhere else
- when item text of `+` menu overlaps with e.g. folder name it becomes unreadable
- connecting another USB drive doesn't work

# Ideas

## Important

- auto-choose folder number (maybe provide way for custom name)
- limit folder names to numbers when adding
- allow adding multiple files at once 
- auto-reorder based on track numbers from id3 tags
- write nfc tags with the app
- make mp3 quality configurable

## nice-to-have

- clean drive of unnecessary files
- read nfc tag and show what would be played
