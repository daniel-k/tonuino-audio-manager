# Bugs

- check text before/after (un)plugging usb drive
- shadow of `+` menu button
- close `+` menu when tapping somewhere else
- when item text of `+` menu overlaps with e.g. folder name it becomes unreadable
- connecting another USB drive doesn't work
- deprecation warning: `'static field INFO_OUTPUT_BUFFERS_CHANGED: Int' is deprecated.`
- when a folder gets updated, only invalidate this folder in the cache, not the whole cache

# Ideas

## Important

- make mp3 quality configurable

## nice-to-have

- explicit progress on loading the drive
- clean drive of unnecessary files
- read nfc tag and show what would be played
